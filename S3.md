<h2>S3 AWS</h2>

The S3 service is an object-based storage system. 
We create a container called a bucket - the container which we can upload our objects, and files-.

<h4>Object: </h4>
Consists on a:
<ul>
<li>Key (name of objects)</li>
<li>Version ID </li>
<li>Value - Actual Data</li>
<li>Metadata</li>
<li>Sobresources (aditional configuration)</li>
<li>Access control information </li>
</ul>

You can store any file in S3 up to 5TB.

**BEST PRACTICE: Create buckets in regions that are physically closest to your users to reduce latency.**
